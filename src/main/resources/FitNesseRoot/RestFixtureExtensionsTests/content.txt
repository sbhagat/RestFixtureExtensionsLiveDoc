!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!1 Rest Fixture Acceptance Test Suite

The !-RestFixture-! supports SLIM as test runner. The format of the test table is basically the same as the one needed for Fit runner with the exception 
of the first cell on the first row. !-RestFixture-! in fact is a Slim !-TableTable-! therefore the class name needs now to be prefixed with "Table".
